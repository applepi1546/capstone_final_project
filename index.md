        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>I began learning computer science during my sophomore year of high school with a foundational Java programming class. This sparked my interest and passion for problem-solving and coding. Since then, I’ve diversified my programming skills, mastering Python and C++ alongside Java. This versatility enables me to choose the best language for a given project.</p>
        <p>Mobile app development, though not an initial focus, became an exciting challenge during my journey. Learning Android Studio provided valuable insights and skills that I plan to leverage in future projects. Additionally, I gained essential database knowledge with SQL and MongoDB, equipping me to handle modern application requirements efficiently.</p>
        <p>My skills align with my career goal of becoming a data analyst. Python's prominence in data analysis and MongoDB's popularity in enterprise applications ensure that I am well-prepared for this path. By continuously learning and adapting, I aim to meet industry demands and excel in my field.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This project, originally created in C++ during CS210, involved designing a clock program that converts military time to AM/PM format. It also allowed users to increment the clock by one hour, minute, or second.</p>
        <h3>Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rewrote the project in Python.</li>
            <li>Added a live, self-running clock feature.</li>
            <li>Allowed users to manually input the hours, minutes, and seconds to adjust.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These enhancements automated the clock functionality, making it more user-friendly and interactive. This project demonstrates my ability to refactor and optimize code for better usability.</p>
